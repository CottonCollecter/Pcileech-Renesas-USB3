# Pcileech-Renesas-USB3
ðŸš€ Project: Pcileech-Renesas-USB3  

ðŸ”Ž Overview  
This project provides an FPGA-based DMA firmware that mimics a Renesas USB3 XHCI controller.  
It integrates with the Pcileech research tool, appearing as a standard device 

âš¡ Key Features  
- Identifies as a Renesas USB3 XHCI controller.  
- Stealth integration with the Pcileech framework.  
- Useful for research and exploration of USB3/PCIe interactions.  

ðŸŽ¯ Purpose  
This release is intended for:  
- Researchers exploring DMA and USB3 stealth techniques.  
- **For research and learning purposes only â€” not intended for misuse.**
